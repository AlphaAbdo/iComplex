# iComplex
A complex-plane interface for visualizing fractals, with a focus on high performance and usability.
# Description
This project is a **high-performance** real-time fractal visualization tool that allows you to explore the complex plane with unprecedented speed and flexibility. Designed with a focus on efficiency, it leverages parallel computation using CUDA and OpenGL for smooth and responsive rendering. The tool is highly modular, enabling dynamic loading of CUDA kernels and a seamless, interactive interface powered by IMGUI. Its architecture is optimized to minimize frame time, making it suitable for both casual exploration and in-depth fractal research.
